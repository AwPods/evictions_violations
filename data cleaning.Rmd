Setup

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(knitr)
library(sf)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(mapview)
```


```{r load evictions data}
evic = read.csv("./data/evictions.csv")

uhf = st_read("./UHF_42_DOHMH_2009/UHF_42_DOHMH_2009.shp")
```

```{r rename and clean}
evic =janitor::clean_names(evic)

uhf = janitor::clean_names(uhf)

# change date format
evic$executed_date <- mdy(evic$executed_date)

# add year to data 
evic = evic |>
  mutate(year = format(executed_date, "%Y"))
```

#### EDA

```{r Eviction EDA}
# eviction by boroughs
evic |>
  group_by(borough) |>
  summarize(Num_evic = n())|>
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Borough", "Number of Evictions"))

# evictions by year
evic |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(num_evic = n()) |>
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Year", "Number of Evictions"))

# by both
evic |>
  group_by(year, borough) |>
  summarize(num_evic = n()) |>
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Year", "NYC boroughs", "Number of Evictions"))
```


```{r bar graphs}
# by borough
evic |>
  ggplot(aes(x = borough))+
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x ="NYC Boroughs",
        y = "Number of Evictions")

# by year
evic |>
  filter(!(year == 2025)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year))+
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Year",
        y = "Number of Evictions")

# Stacked up by borough
evic|>
  group_by(year) %>%
  count(borough) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = borough)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Evictions")
  
```

```{r map coordinates}
# try not to run it, too slow
evic_24= evic |>
  filter(year == 2024) |>
  na.omit()
mapview(evic_24, xcol = "longitude", ycol = "latitude", crs = 4269, grid = FALSE)
```

#### Using UHF

```{r uhf}
# Mapping with UHF polygons (see the 42 neighborhoods)
ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data = uhf)
```
